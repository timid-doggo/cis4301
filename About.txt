  Welcome to our webpage! This is hosting our oracle database which contains information from the 2014 National Survey on Drug Use and 
  Health. The survey is a nation wide survey that usually picks 70,000 people to participate in this. It is apart of a huge project which 
  goals are to monitor drug abuse and see if there is a way to help people dealing with abuse. Our website will give the user the ability 
  to filter through the database in many ways and provide readily available data. The users will be able to find statistics about drug use 
  and how it affects people in all kinds of different ways.
